This project is an attempt to temporarily fix dotnet/maui#11088 . 

This is forked from [this repo] (https://github.com/datvm/LukeMauiFilePicker)  [quicker to just do this and reference in my app for now than figure out how to do a pull request, dont judge me! :-D, will figure that out if I fix what I need]

Please see docs there.

I have fixed:

1) MacOs, not showing full FileResult which contains full path.

[Havent tested this on other platforms, but will be testingon windows and will update that if its needs it]

Available as Nuget Here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/BrighterTools.MauiFilePicker/1.0.0
